# Airi
A simple scheduling app I made for my mom because the government can't provide one on its own or something. **Specifically designed for scheduling medical appointments.**

## Overview
Airi is a lightweight offline-first desktop app designed to help users manage their schedules easily. Built with a modern stack, airi offers a clean and easy-to-use interface, making it simple for **anyone** to organize their daily tasks.
